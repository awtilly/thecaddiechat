  <section class="section-pad"><div class="article-body"><p>There's something surreal about walking alongside a major champion. Matt Fitzpatrick, the 2022 U.S. Open winner, carries himself with a quiet precision that mirrors his game — methodical, deliberate, and remarkably consistent. Caddying for him during the BMW Championship practice round was one of the most educational experiences of my life inside the ropes.</p>
<p>Olympia Fields Country Club provided the perfect stage. The course demands accuracy, course management, and patience — qualities that define Fitzpatrick's approach to the game.</p>
<h2>Precision Personified</h2>
<p>What separates Fitzpatrick from many of his peers is his process. Every shot begins with a detailed assessment — wind, lie, distance, pin position, and perhaps most importantly, the shot shape required. He doesn't overpower courses; he outthinks them.</p>
<p>As his caddie for the day, I gained a front-row seat to this process. The communication between a tour player and their caddie is constant and nuanced. Fitzpatrick would talk through options, weigh the risks, and commit fully once the decision was made.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">Fitzpatrick doesn't overpower courses; he outthinks them. Every shot is a chess move.</div>
<p>His short game was particularly impressive to witness up close. The touch and feel around the greens — the ability to land a ball on a specific blade of grass and have it react exactly as intended — is something that truly must be seen in person to appreciate.</p>
<h2>A Champion's Mindset</h2>
<p>What I'll carry with me from this experience is Fitzpatrick's composure. Nothing rattled him. Bad breaks, tough lies, gusty wind — he processed each challenge with the same steady temperament. That kind of mental consistency is what separates good players from champions.</p>
<p>Once again, this experience was made possible by the Evans Scholars Foundation and the Western Golf Association — organizations that continue to open doors that a caddie from Saint Louis could only dream of walking through.</p></div>
